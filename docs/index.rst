BrainSMASH
**********

BrainSMASH (Brain Surrogate Maps with Spatially Autocorrelated Heterogeneity) is a
python-based computational platform for statistical testing of spatially
autocorrelated brain maps. At the core of BrainSMASH is functionality to
simulate surrogate brain maps with spatial autocorrelation that is matched
to the spatial autocorrelation in an empirical map. Additional utilities are included
for users utilizing Connectome Workbench style surface-based neuroimaging files.
