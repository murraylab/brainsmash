BrainSMASH
**********

BrainSMASH (Brain Surrogate Maps with Autocorrelated Spatial Heterogeneity) is a
python-based computational platform for statistical testing of spatially
autocorrelated brain maps. At the core of BrainSMASH is functionality to
simulate surrogate brain maps with spatial autocorrelation that is matched
to the spatial autocorrelation in an empirical map. Additional utilities are provided
for Connectome Workbench users who wish to analyze surface-based neuroimaging files.
